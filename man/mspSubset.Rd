\title{Multi-State Subsetting}
\usage{
mspSubset(data, labelVector = rep(1, nrow(data)),
  subsetMatrix = matrix(TRUE, nrow = length(unique(labelVector)), ncol =
  ncol(data)))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An xts data matrix}

\item{labelVector}{Class labels as a logical (two states only) or
finite numeric (two or more states) vector or matrix column (not
from a data frame) with length equal to the number of rows in "data."
For data with only one state, this will be a vector of 1s.}

\item{subsetMatrix}{A matrix of logicals with number of rows equal to the number of
states and number of columns equal to the number of columns in data. The i,j entry in
the matrix indicates whether or not to monitor the jth variable in the
ith state.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{Class1Data -- }{an xts data matrix containing the subset of the state 1 data.}
\item{Class2Data -- }{an xts data matrix containing the subset of the state 2 data.}
\item{Class3Data -- }{an xts data matrix containing the subset of the state 3 data.}
}
\description{
This function separates the data into k subsets, one for each
of the k states, containing the subset of the original variables that are of interest
for a given state.
}
\details{
This function is designed to be used in conjunction with \code{\link{mspTrain}}
and to allow the user to monitor a different subset of the variables during each state.
